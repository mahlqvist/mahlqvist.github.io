            <h3 class="content-heading">The Computer</h3>
            <p>Digital technology is used to store and process data into useful information. Humans have been inventing tools to solve problems throughout the history and a machine to solve thinking problems is no exception.</p> 
            <p>Computer scientists realized a thinking machine have to perform certain tasks like take input, store information, process information and output results.</p>
            <p>These four different tasks are common to all computers, and what makes a computer, a computer!</p>

            <h3 class="content-heading">Charles Babbage</h3>
            <p>Charles Babbage was a mathematician and mechanical engineer who is called the father of the computer. He designed the Analytical Engine, which is considered to be the first ever general-purpose computer, even though it was never built.</p>
            <p>The Analytical Engine was first described in 1837 and was a mechanical object, meaning it would be powered by steam or some similar source of power, since this was before vacuum tubes and transitors. It used a complex mechanism which allowed the machine to repeat a deck of punch cards, so as to execute a loop.</p>

            <h3 class="content-heading">Ada Lovelace</h3>
            <p>Ada Lovelace or Ada King, countess of Lovelace is often referred to as the first programmer. She developed the first algorithm for the Analytical Enginge, that could compute Bernoulli numbers. While Babbage designed the machine, Lovelace actually described what you could do with it.</p>
            <p>Fundamentally computers are for executing algorithms, which is basically a series of steps that solves a specific problem. Lovelace described the first computer algorithm, but her algorithm was never tested, since the machine was never completed.</p>

            <h3 class="content-heading">Alan Turing</h3>
            <p>Alan Turing was a mathematician and is considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. He developed the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer and during World War II, Turing played a key part in cracking the german Enigma Machine.</p> 
            <p>A Turing complete system means a system in which a program can be written that will find an answer (although with no guarantees regarding runtime or memory), in other words, a device that can solve any computational problem.</p>
            <p>The Turing test, originally called the imitation game by Alan Turing is a deceptively simple method of determining whether a machine can demonstrate human intelligence. If a machine can engage in a conversation with a human without being detected as a machine, it has demonstrated human intelligence.</p>

            <h3 class="content-heading">The ENIAC</h3>
            <p>The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer was the first electronic general-purpose digital computer. It was Turing complete, and able to solve problems through reprogramming and had around 17000 vacuum tubes.</p>
            <p>Vacuum tubes work by removing the air from a tube to create a vacuum which gives the electrons a clear path from the cathode to the anode, which creates a current.</p>
            <p>Vacuum tubes were replace by transitors to control electricity voltages. Transistors could replicate all the functions of tubes, like switching and amplification, but was made out of semiconductor materials which made them more compact and more efficient.</p>

            <p>Admiral Grace Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. She is known for inventing the very first compiler, A-0 and developed Flow-Matic, the first programming language to use English-like commands.</p>
            <p>Compilers made it possible to translate human language via a programming language into machine code. That way programmers didn't need to learn how to write machine code in ones and zeros.</p>

            <h3 class="content-heading">The Xerox Alto</h3>
            <p>The development of hard disk drives and silicon microprocessors made computers smaller. Instead of filling up entire rooms like the ENIAC, they were small enough to fit on tabletops.</p> 
            <p>The Xerox Alto was introduced on March 1, 1973 and was the first computer that resemble computers we're familiar with today. It was also the first computer to implement a graphical user interface, or GUI that used icons, a mouse, and a window.</p>

            <h3 class="content-heading">Personal Computer</h3>
            <p>In the 1970s, a young engineer named Steve Wozniak invented the Apple I, a single-board computer for hobbyists. With his friend Steve Jobs, they created the company Apple Computer. The Apple II was a phenomenal success, selling for nearly two decades and giving a new generation of people access to personal computers.</p>
            <p>In the 1980s, IBM introduced its personal computer with a primitive version of an operating system called MS DOS or Microsoft Disk Operating System. It was widely adopted and made more accessible to consumers, thanks to a partnership with Microsoft and Bill Gates.</p>

            <h3 class="content-heading">Open Source</h3>
            <p>Unix is an operating system developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at AT&T Bell Labs, but since it wasn't cheap or accessible, a programmer by the name of Richard Stallman started developing the GNU project in 1983, to be a free to use operating system with similar functionality to Unix.</p>
            <p>Unlike Windows or Macintosh, GNU wasn't owned by a single company, its code was open source, which meant that anyone could modify and share it.</p> 
            <p>By 1990 the GNU project had all the major components except the kernel. In 1991 Linus Torvalds released a Unix-like kernel called Linux. Combined with the tools developed by the GNU Project, Linux became one of the largest open source projects in history.</p>
