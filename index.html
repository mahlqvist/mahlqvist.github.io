                <p>Digital technology is used to store and process data into useful information. Humans have been
                    inventing tools to solve problems throughout the history and a machine to solve thinking problems is
                    no exception.</p>
                <p>Early computer scientists realized a thinking machine have to perform certain tasks, like <span
                        class="important">take input</span>, <span class="important">store
                        information</span>, <span class="important">process information</span> and <span
                        class="important">output results</span>.</p>
                <p>These four different tasks are common to all computers, and <strong>what makes a computer, a
                        computer</strong>!</p>

                <p>Charles Babbage is called the father of the computer and was a mathematician and mechanical engineer
                    who designed the Analytical Engine. It's considered to be the first ever general-purpose
                    computer, even though it was never built.</p>
                <p>The Analytical Engine was first described in 1837 and was a mechanical object, meaning it would be
                    powered by steam or some similar source of power (this was before vacuum tubes and transitors).
                    It used a complex mechanism which allowed the machine to repeat a deck of punch cards, so as to
                    execute a loop.</p>

                <p>Ada Lovelace or Ada King, countess of Lovelace is often referred to as the first programmer because she developed the first algorithm for the Analytical Enginge. 
                    While Babbage designed the machine, Lovelace actually described what you could do with it.</p>
                <p>Fundamentally computers are for executing algorithms, which is basically a series of steps that
                    solves a specific problem. Lovelace described the first computer algorithm that could compute Bernoulli numbers. Since the machine was never completed, her algorithm was never tested.</p>

                <h3 class="content-heading">Alan Turing</h3>
                <p>Alan Turing was a mathematician, computer scientist, cryptanalyst and philosopher and is considered to be the father of theoretical computer science
                    and artificial intelligence. He developed the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a
                    general-purpose computer and Turing played a key part in cracking the german
                    Enigma Machine during World War II.</p>
                <p>A <strong>Turing complete</strong> system means a system in which a program can be written that will find an answer
                    (although with no guarantees regarding runtime or memory), in other words, a device that can solve
                    any computational problem.</p>
                <p>The <strong>Turing test</strong>, originally called the imitation game by Alan Turing is a deceptively simple method
                    of determining whether a machine can demonstrate human intelligence. If a machine can engage in a
                    conversation with a human without being detected as a machine, it has demonstrated human
                    intelligence.</p>

                    computer</strong>. It was Turing complete, and able to solve problems through reprogramming and had around
                    17000 vacuum tubes.</p>
                <p>Vacuum tubes work by removing the air from a tube to create a vacuum which gives the electrons a
                    clear path from the cathode to the anode, which creates a current.</p>
                <p>Vacuum tubes were replace by transitors to control electricity voltages. Transistors could replicate
                    all the functions of tubes, like switching and amplification, but was made out of semiconductor
                    materials which made them more compact and more efficient.</p>

                <p>Compilers made it possible to translate human language via a programming language into machine code.

                <p>The development of hard disk drives and silicon microprocessors made computers smaller. Instead of
                    filling up entire rooms like the ENIAC, they were small enough to fit on tabletops.</p>
                <p>The Xerox Alto was introduced on March 1, 1973 and was the first computer that resemble computers
                    we're familiar with today. It was also the first computer to implement a graphical user interface,
                    or GUI that used icons, a mouse, and a window.</p>

                <p>In the 1970s, a young engineer named <span class="important">Steve Wozniak</span> invented the Apple I, a single-board computer for
                    hobbyists. With his friend <span class="important">Steve Jobs</span>, they created the company Apple Computer. The Apple II and later the Apple Macintosh with MacOS using a graphical user interface (GUI) were phenomenal successes, giving a new generation of people access to
                    personal computers.</p>
                <p>In the 1980s, IBM introduced its personal computer with a primitive version of an operating system
                    called MS-DOS or Microsoft Disk Operating System, thanks to a partnership with Microsoft and <span class="important">Bill Gates</span>. In 1985 Windows was introduced as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the Apple Macintosh realeased the year before.</p>

                <p>Unix is an operating system developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at AT&T Bell Labs. Since Unix wasn't cheap or accessible to the public, a programmer by the name of <span class="important">Richard Stallman</span> started developing the GNU project in 1983. It was a free to use operating system with similar functionality to Unix. </p>
                <p>Unlike <span class="important">Windows</span> or <span class="important">MacOS</span>, GNU wasn't owned by a single company, its code was open source, which
                    meant that anyone could modify and share it.</p>
                <p>By 1990 the GNU project had all the major components except the kernel. In 1991 <span class="important">Linus Torvalds</span>
                    released a Unix-like kernel called <span class="important">Linux</span>. Combined with the tools developed by the GNU Project,
                    Linux became one of the largest open source projects in history.</p>
